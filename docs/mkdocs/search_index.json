            "text": "This document will provide you with all basic infos you need to get started with developing a module for the \u201cAssistance Platform\u201d.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\u00b6\n\n\nAssistance platform\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Assistance Platform is a project which aims on providing assistance to the user in all thinkable situations. For example notify the user in certain situations or set his phone to silent mode in a meeting. BUT the Assistance Platform itself isn\u2019t that intelligent in the first place. It basically \u201cjust\u201d offers a nice technical interface for clients to push and pull data. The real value comes form so called \u201cmodules\u201d, see the following section.## \n\n\nModule\n\u00b6\n\n\nA module is some sort of extension of the \u201cAssistance Platform\u201d. It should implement assistance logic (when to notify the user, when to send a mail etc.) but it can also implement the extraction of higher-level information from a stream of user / device events. So as a module developer you will implement an \u201cAssistance Module\u201d and (optionally) a \u201cData (Processing) Module\u201d. Multiple Modules (normally one Assistance and one Data Module) are put together in a so called \u201cModule Bundle\u201d. More of that later.\n\n\nBasic workflow / communication ways\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe platform does collect necessary data from registered (and active) user. For example it tracks the position and app usage. Furthermore users can activate (and deactivate) modules to support the user. \n\n\nProactive assistance\n\u00b6\n\n\nAll activated modules will be notified by the platform about the users events (e.g. positions). Data Modules then are able to receive and process these events and gain higher level events. Assistance Modules then can react on those higher level events and tell the platform to trigger some action on the client device(s), e.g. send a notification, set display brightness. \n\n\nReactive assistance\n\u00b6\n\n\nA user can always request current assistance information from the platform. The platform will then ask all activated modules (for this particular user) if they have relevant information. The responses of the modules will be collected, prioritized and sent back to the requesting user who then can inspect the offered assistance. A module can specifiy to show text, images, maps, links, etc.. These information are organized in so called \u201cInformation Cards\u201d. Each module can provide such a \u201cInformation Card\u201d which is then presented to the user, alongside the \u201cInformation Cards\u201d of other modules (if any).\n\n\nOverview Platform\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere you find an very simplified image over the interactions between clients, platform and modules.\n\n\n\n\nGetting started!\n\u00b6\n\n\nSo now you should be able to somehow understand the concept and you want to implement your own module, what to do? This guide will show you how to implement a \u201cDrive calm\u201d module. It should measure the speed of a user and proactively warn him if he is going faster than 100km/h. The reactive assistance should show him how fast he is going.\n\n\nHint: You don\u2019t like tutorials and want to immediately get hands on working code?\n\u00b6\n\n\nCheck out the repository and have a look at the \u201cDriveCalmModule\u201d project. [TODO ggf. Link einf\u00fcgen und so]\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\u00b6\n\n\nPlease make sure you have the following things installed on your developer machine:\n\n JDK8\n\n Appropriate Java IDE (e.g. Eclipse)\n* Maven\n\n\nCreate your project\n\u00b6\n\n\nCreate a new maven project and give it the name \u201cDriveCalmModule\u201d. Then add the following dependency to your pom.xml:\n\n\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform</groupId>\n  <artifactId>AssistancePlatformModuleAPI</artifactId>\n  <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>\n</dependency>\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore add the following repo to your pom.xml:\n\n\n    <repositories>\n        <repository>\n            <releases>\n                <enabled>false</enabled>\n                <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy>\n                <checksumPolicy>warn</checksumPolicy>\n            </releases>\n            <snapshots>\n                <enabled>true</enabled>\n                <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy>\n                <checksumPolicy>fail</checksumPolicy>\n            </snapshots>\n            <id>assi-nexus</id>\n            <name>Assi Nexus</name>\n            <url>http://130.83.163.56:9001/content/repositories/snapshots</url>\n            <layout>default</layout>\n        </repository>\n    </repositories>\n\n\n\n\nWhat to implement first?\n\u00b6\n\n\nSo as a module developer your are extending a very specific family of classes and therewith specify your \u201cModule Bundle\u201d. So the starting point for your module will be the extension of the \nModuleBundle\n class:\n\n\npackage de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.drivecalm.module;\n\nimport de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.modules.Module;\nimport de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.modules.bundle.ModuleBundle;\nimport de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.modules.bundle.ModuleBundleInformation;\n\npublic class DriveCalmModuleBundle extends ModuleBundle {\n\n    @Override\n    public String getModuleId() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public ModuleBundleInformation getBundleInformation() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected Module[] initializeContainedModules() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nSo what you will need to implement is:\n\n \ngetModuleId()\n - Just return the ID of your module, make sure that it is unique.\n\n \ngetBundleInformation()\n - Here you can specify the bundle information. These are mainly needed for presenting relevant information to the end-user.\n* \ninitializeContainedModules()\n - This is the most important part. Here you\u2019ll construct the contained Assistance and Data Module(s)\n\n\nLets begin with the super-simple \ngetModuleId\n method:\n\n\nprivate static final String ID = \"de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.drivecalm\";\n\n@Override\npublic String getModuleId() {\n    return ID;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThen implement the \ngetBundleInformation()\n method like following:\n\n\n@Override\npublic ModuleBundleInformation getBundleInformation() {\n    String name = \"Drive calm\";\n    String logoUrl = \"http://urltologo\";\n    String shortDescription = \"Helps you maintaining a moderate speed limit while driving\";\n    String longDescription = \"This module will measure your speed and warn you if you go faster then 100km/h. In the request-assistance mode you can view your current speed.\";\n    String copyright = \"Copyright by YOU 2015\";\n    String devMail = \"youremail@adress.com\";\n    String supportMail = devMail;\n\n    Capability[] requiredCapabilities = new Capability[] { new Capability(\n            \"position\", 1, 2) };\n\n    Capability[] optionalCapabilites = new Capability[] { new Capability(\n            \"motionactivity\", 1, 2) };\n\n    ModuleBundleInformation info = new ModuleBundleInformation(name,\n            logoUrl, shortDescription, longDescription,\n            requiredCapabilities, optionalCapabilites, copyright, devMail,\n            supportMail);\n\n    return info;\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhat did happen here? We declared a \nModuleBundleInformation\n object which contains name, description, etc.. From the technical point of view the \nmost important thing here is the definition of the so called \u201cCapabilities\u201d\n. \n\n\nWith capabilities you define the requirements that your module needs from the users devices. For the required capabilities we defined the following parameters:\n\n \n\"position\"\n - Event Type - This is the name of the sensor / event we need from the users device. In this case long / lat position events.\n\n \n1\n - Collection Interval - We want the device to collect these evens in an interval of 1 second and store them locally.\n* \n2\n - Required update interval - We want to get the events delivered at least in an interval of 2 seconds\n\n\nBeside the required capabilities a module can define optional capabilities, that it can use to improve the assistance quality. In the case above we request \u201cmotion activity\u201d events, which can tell the probability that a user is driving.\n\n\nHere you can find out which sensors / event types are available: \nSensor types and API mapping\n\n\nThe next step is implementing the \ninitializedContainedModules()\n method:\n\n\n@Override\nprotected Module[] initializeContainedModules() {\n    Module assistanceModule = new DriveCalmAssistanceModule();\n    Module dataModule = new DriveCalmDataModule();\n\n    return new Module[] {\n        assistanceModule,\n        dataModule\n    };\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou just instantiate your modules and return them combined in an array. But wait\u2026 we don\u2019t have these classes yet? Yes, right, lets create them!\n\n\nImplementing the modules\n\u00b6\n\n\nData Module\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe goal of the data module is to detect if the user is going faste than 100km/h and firing a respective event, so the assistance module can react on this. The raw skeleton will look like this:\n\n\npackage de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.drivecalm.module;\n\nimport de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.modules.DataModule;\n\npublic class DriveCalmDataModule extends DataModule {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void doBeforeStartup() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void doAfterStartup() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe will need to implement the \ndoBeforeStartup\n method. The \ndoAfterStartup\n method can be left blank.\n\n\nThe \ndoBeforeStartup\n method can be used to register a event listener for specific type of events (e.g. position). It can also be used to start specific algorithms or a Apache Spark application.\n\n\nHere is the plan for our simple module:\n\n Listen for positions events\n\n Store the last event of a user in a local hashmap\n\n On each new event calculate the traveled distance between the two positions\n\n Therewith calculate the speed and fire a \nDriveCalmRecommendationEvent\n\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\n\n    private HashMap<Long, Position> lastUserPositions = new HashMap<>();\n\n    private static final double kmPerHourThreshold = 100;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void doBeforeStartup() {\n        this.registerForEventOfType(Position.class, this::consumeEvent);\n    }\n\n    private void consumeEvent(Channel<Position> channel, Position newEvent) {\n        Long userId = newEvent.userId;\n\n        // Try getting the last user position\n        Position lastPosition = getLastUserPosition(userId);\n\n        // // If this isn't the first position then\n        if (lastPosition == null) {\n            // Create a new position entry for the current value\n            setLastUserPosition(newEvent);\n        } else {\n            // // We have a last position, so we can calculate a distance\n            // Check if the last position is older then the new position\n            if (lastPosition.getTimestamp().before(newEvent.getTimestamp())) {\n                // Difference based speed\n                double calculatedSpeed = (lastPosition.distance(newEvent) / 1000.0)\n                        / ((newEvent.getTimestamp().getTime() - lastPosition\n                                .getTimestamp().getTime()) / 1000.0 / 60. / 60.0);\n\n                DriveCalmRecommendationEvent recommendationEvent = buildRecommendationEvent(newEvent, calculatedSpeed);\n\n                if (calculatedSpeed > kmPerHourThreshold) {\n                    fireDriveCalmRecommendationForPosition(recommendationEvent);\n                }\n\n                // Mark this event as last position of user\n                setLastUserPosition(newEvent);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private DriveCalmRecommendationEvent buildRecommendationEvent(Position pos, double speed) {\n        DriveCalmRecommendationEvent event = new DriveCalmRecommendationEvent();\n        event.userId = pos.userId;\n        event.deviceId = pos.deviceId;\n        event.speed = speed;\n        event.timestamp = pos.timestamp;\n\n        return event;\n    }\n\n    private void fireDriveCalmRecommendationForPosition(Position pos) {\n        DriveCalmRecommendationEvent eventToFire = new DriveCalmRecommendationEvent();\n        eventToFire.userId = pos.userId;\n        this.emitEvent(eventToFire);\n    }\n\n\n\n\nThe detection logic could have been simplified by just checking the \nspeed\n attribute of the \nPosition\n event, but I wanted to present a slightly more complex alternative.\n\n\nImportant is the \nemitEvent\n method. Therewith we can push events into the event stream so other modules (including our Assistance module) can receive the information. We\u2019ll fire a \nDriveCalmRecommendationEvent\n - extends \nUserDeviceEvent\n (implies user id and device id) and adds a \nspeed\n field.\n\n\npackage de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.drivecalm.module;\n\nimport de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.data.UserDeviceEvent;\n\npublic class DriveCalmRecommendationEvent extends UserDeviceEvent {\n    public double speed;\n\n    public double getSpeed() {\n        return speed;\n    }\n\n    public void setSpeed(double speed) {\n        this.speed = speed;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAssistanceModule\n\u00b6\n\n\nSo now we have the logic which detects the exceedance of 100km/h and then fires an respective event. We now want to write an \u201cAssistance Module\u201d which reacts to those \nDriveCalmRecommendationEvent\n events and warns the user. So lets start with an empty extension of the \nAssistanceModule\n class.\n\n\npackage de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.drivecalm.module;\n\nimport java.util.Collection;\n\nimport de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.modules.assistance.AssistanceModule;\nimport de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.modules.assistance.informationprovider.IInformationCardCustomizer;\nimport de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.services.modulerestserver.MappedServlet;\n\npublic class DriveCalmAssistanceModule extends AssistanceModule {\n    @Override\n    protected void doBeforeStartup() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void doAfterStartup() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected IInformationCardCustomizer generateInformationCardCustomizer() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected Collection<MappedServlet> generateCustomServelets() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nFirst lets go through the methods that can be implemented:\n\n \ndoBeforeStartup\n - Again here you can register for events, like in data modules. We\u2019ll register a listener for \nDriveCalmRecommendationEvent\ns.\n\n \ndoAfterStartup\n - E.g. start services. We\u2019ll leave it blank in this example.\n\n \ngenerateInformationCardCustomizer\n - Implement this if you want to provide a request-based assistance and provide so called \u201cInformation Cards\u201d to the user. We\u2019ll provide the last known speed of the user here.\n\n \ngenerateCustomServelets\n - Can be used to implement a custom REST Webservice for custom Client-Apps. We\u2019ll leave this blank for now.\n\n\nProactive assistance\n\u00b6\n\n\nLets start with the event listener:\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void doBeforeStartup() {\n        this.registerForEventOfType(DriveCalmRecommendationEvent.class,\n                this::consumeDriveCalmRecommendation);\n    }\n\n    private void consumeDriveCalmRecommendation(\n            Channel<DriveCalmRecommendationEvent> channel,\n            DriveCalmRecommendationEvent event) {\n        getActionRunner().showMessage(event.userId,\n                new long[] { event.deviceId }, \"Exceeded speed threshold!\",\n                \"You are going \" + event.speed + \" km/h. Drive slower!\");\n    }\n\n\n\n\nInteresting here is the \ngetActionRunner()\n call. The action runner provides is a set of methods you can use to trigger actions on the client side, like showing a push message in this case. You just pass the receivers UserID + DeviceID(s) and set a title / message. The distribution to the devices will be handled by the platform. Now we have finished the proactive assistance - if the user is driving faster then 100km/h he will be presented with the specified message.\n\n\nReactive assistance (using Cassandra persistency!)\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen the user opens his client he wants to get the most up-to-date information from his activated modules. The abstraction you need to implement therefore is a implementation of \nIInformationCardCustomizer\n and instantiate it in the \ngenerateInformationCardCustomizer\n method. The implementation of the \nIInformationCardCustomizer\n interface defines the customization of the \nModuleInformationCard\n which will be sent to the client.\n\n\nPreparing the data module for saving events\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn our case we\u2019ll just send back the current speed. But where to get that value from? Basically we calculate it in the Data Module, but we need to save the last speed somehow to make it available at request from the client. So at first we\u2019ll want to extend the Data Module code. We need to add the following steps:\n\n Create the required Cassandra Table Schema on startup.\n\n On each position change save the calculated speed.\n\n\nSo here are the modifications to the data module:\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void doBeforeStartup() {\n        createSchema(); // This is new!\n        this.registerForEventOfType(Position.class, this::consumeEvent);\n    }\n\n    private void createSchema() { // This is new!\n        String schemaCQL = \"CREATE TABLE drive_calm_speeds \"\n                + \"(speed double, \"\n                + \"device_id bigint, \"\n                + \"user_id bigint, \"\n                + \"id uuid, \"\n                + \"timestamp timestamp, \"\n                + \"PRIMARY KEY (user_id)\"\n                + \") \";\n\n        CassandraServiceFactory.getSessionProxy().createSchema(schemaCQL);\n    }\n\n\n\n\nNext we add the save routine \n\n\n    private void consumeEvent(Channel<Position> channel, Position newEvent) {\n        Long userId = newEvent.userId;\n\n        // Try getting the last user position\n        Position lastPosition = getLastUserPosition(userId);\n\n        // // If this isn't the first position then\n        if (lastPosition == null) {\n            // Create a new position entry for the current value\n            setLastUserPosition(newEvent);\n        } else {\n            // // We have a last position, so we can calculate a distance\n            // Check if the last position is older then the new position\n            if (lastPosition.getTimestamp().before(newEvent.getTimestamp())) {\n                // Difference based speed\n                double calculatedSpeed = (lastPosition.distance(newEvent) / 1000.0)\n                        / ((newEvent.getTimestamp().getTime() - lastPosition\n                                .getTimestamp().getTime()) / 1000.0 / 60. / 60.0);\n\n                DriveCalmRecommendationEvent recommendationEvent = buildRecommendationEvent(newEvent, calculatedSpeed);\n\n                if (calculatedSpeed > kmPerHourThreshold) {\n                    fireDriveCalmRecommendationForPosition(recommendationEvent);\n                }\n\n                // Save in any case the current speed (THIS IS NEW!)\n                saveDriveCalmRecommendationForPosition(recommendationEvent);\n\n                // Mark this event as last position of user\n                setLastUserPosition(newEvent);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n        ...\n\n    private void saveDriveCalmRecommendationForPosition(DriveCalmRecommendationEvent eventToFire) {\n        this.getEventPersistency().persist(eventToFire);\n    }\n\n\n\n\nWhat does happen here? After calculating the \nDriveCalmRecommendationEvent\n we save it (despite the user exceeded the threshold or not). Therefore we use the \ngetEventPersistency()\n method which provides a implementation of the \nIUserDeviceEventPersistency\n which provides a \npersist(event)\n method. This is a convenience method to save events. In order for this to work we need to add the following \n@Table\n annotation to the \nDriveCalmRecommendationEvent\n (it tells which table to map the class to):\n\n\n@Table(name = \"drive_calm_speeds\")\npublic class DriveCalmRecommendationEvent extends UserDeviceEvent {\n...\n}\n\n\n\n\nProvide the last speed information on request\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn the last section we saved the most current speed to the Cassandra Database. We now want to provide a possibility for the user / client to get the last speed. Therefore we implement the \ngenerateInformationCardCustomizer\n which provides a implementation of the \nIInformationCardCustomizer\n interface.\nIn order to keep it simple, we\u2019ll use an anonymous \u201cinline\u201d interface implementation here. Here are the basic steps:\n\n Prepare a Cassandra query to get the speed of a user\n\n On request (\ncustomizeModuleInformationCard\n) get the last speed of the database.\n* Customize the card by setting the timestamp and payload (-> speed)\n\n\n[TODO: Wenn Template / View Kram gekl\u00e4rt ist hier einbinden]\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected IInformationCardCustomizer generateInformationCardCustomizer() {\n        PreparedStatement ps = getCassandraSession().prepare(\"SELECT * FROM drive_calm_speeds WHERE user_id = ? LIMIT 1\");\n\n        return new IInformationCardCustomizer() {\n\n            @Override\n            public void customizeModuleInformationCard(ModuleInformationCard card,\n                    long userId, long deviceId) {\n                ResultSet rs = getCassandraSession().execute(ps.bind(userId));\n\n                Row row = rs.one();\n\n                if(row != null) {\n                    // The timestamp should be set to represent the \"up-to-dateness\"\n                    card.timestamp = row.getTimestamp(\"timestamp\");\n\n                    // Set the payload to the saved speed (this is the information which will be presented to the user)\n                    card.payload = Double.toString(row.getDouble(\"speed\"));\n                }\n            }\n        };\n    }\n\n\n\n\nThe code should be straight forward. There are two important things: Note that the timestamp of the card is explicitly set, otherwise it\u2019ll be zero - that means, that it will be very unimportant for the user. Try to give a timestamp which is representative for the \u201ccurrentness\u201d of the module information. Another important thing to note is that the \ngetCassandraSession()\n is provided by the API. So you get a preconfigured Cassandra Session with which you can work with :+1:. But always be sure to think of efficient indexing and querying of the Cassandra Database!\n\n\nFire this thing up!\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe last step to get this running is adding a main method. For the sake of simplicity we add it to the module bundle. Assuming you want to run the module against the default system just use:\n\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ModuleBundle bundle = new DriveCalmModuleBundle();\n    BundleBootstrapper.bootstrap(bundle);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis\u2019ll initialize everything for you and start the module.\n\n\nIn case you are running a local test system (e.g. via Docker [TODO Link einf\u00fcgen]), then you can also pass a address of the platform, e.g.:\n\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ModuleBundle bundle = new DriveCalmModuleBundle();\n    boolean localMode = true;\n    BundleBootstrapper.bootstrap(bundle, \"ip:port\", localMode);\n}\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore you see the declaration of localMode. This will deactivate the remote Apache Spark features and perform the respective computations on the locally available CPUs.\n\n\nDeployment\n\u00b6\n\n\n[TODO Jenkins usw. erkl\u00e4ren]\n\n\nApache Spark Requirements\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf your data module uses Apache Spark as processing engine then you need to provide a \u201cfat jar\u201d. This \u201cfat jar\u201d has to be saved in USER_HOME/{MODULE_ID}.jar on the machine which runs the Module Bundle.\n\n\nRoom for improvements\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nPr\u00fcfen wann letzte Nachricht gesendet wurde um Spam zu vermeiden\n\n\nUse user settings for the threshold\n\n\n\n\nWhere to go from now?\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo get an overview which data is available you should inspect the \nde.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.data\n package which contains the sensor / event POJOs.\n\n\nFurthermore you should inspect the provided \nAssistanceModuleAPI\n and especially the provided services.\n\n Client Action Runner\n\n Persistency\n* Custom Servlets\n\n\nIf you want to develop complex modules you should deep dive into \nApache Spark\n and its \nDocs\n.",

So the starting point for your module will be the extension of the  ModuleBundle  class:  package de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.drivecalm.module;\n\nimport de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.modules.Module;\nimport de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.modules.bundle.ModuleBundle;\nimport de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.modules.bundle.ModuleBundleInformation;\n\npublic class DriveCalmModuleBundle extends ModuleBundle {\n\n    @Override\n    public String getModuleId() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public ModuleBundleInformation getBundleInformation() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected Module[] initializeContainedModules() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        return null;\n    }\n}  So what you will need to implement is:   getModuleId()  - Just return the ID of your module, make sure that it is unique.   getBundleInformation()  - Here you can specify the bundle information. These are mainly needed for presenting relevant information to the end-user.\n*  initializeContainedModules()  - This is the most important part. Here you\u2019ll construct the contained Assistance and Data Module(s)  Lets begin with the super-simple  getModuleId  method:  private static final String ID = \"de.tudarmstadt.informatik.tk.assistanceplatform.drivecalm\";\n\n@Override\npublic String getModuleId() {\n    return ID;\n}  Then implement the  getBundleInformation()  method like following:  @Override\npublic ModuleBundleInformation getBundleInformation() {\n    String name = \"Drive calm\";\n    String logoUrl = \"http://urltologo\";\n    String shortDescription = \"Helps you maintaining a moderate speed limit while driving\";\n    String longDescription = \"This module will measure your speed and warn you if you go faster then 100km/h. In the request-assistance mode you can view your current speed.\";\n    String copyright = \"Copyright by YOU 2015\";\n    String devMail = \"youremail@adress.com\";\n    String supportMail = devMail;\n\n    Capability[] requiredCapabilities = new Capability[] { new Capability(\n            \"position\", 1, 2) };\n\n    Capability[] optionalCapabilites = new Capability[] { new Capability(\n            \"motionactivity\", 1, 2) };\n\n    ModuleBundleInformation info = new ModuleBundleInformation(name,\n            logoUrl, shortDescription, longDescription,\n            requiredCapabilities, optionalCapabilites, copyright, devMail,\n            supportMail);\n\n    return info;\n}  What did happen here? We declared a  ModuleBundleInformation  object which contains name, description, etc.. From the technical point of view the  most important thing here is the definition of the so called \u201cCapabilities\u201d .   With capabilities you define the requirements that your module needs from the users devices. For the required capabilities we defined the following parameters:   \"position\"  - Event Type - This is the name of the sensor / event we need from the users device. In this case long / lat position events.   1  - Collection Interval - We want the device to collect these evens in an interval of 1 second and store them locally.\n*  2  - Required update interval - We want to get the events delivered at least in an interval of 2 seconds  Beside the required capabilities a module can define optional capabilities, that it can use to improve the assistance quality. In the case above we request \u201cmotion activity\u201d events, which can tell the probability that a user is driving.  Here you can find out which sensors / event types are available:  Sensor types and API mapping  The next step is implementing the  initializedContainedModules()  method:  @Override\nprotected Module[] initializeContainedModules() {\n    Module assistanceModule = new DriveCalmAssistanceModule();\n    Module dataModule = new DriveCalmDataModule();\n\n    return new Module[] {\n        assistanceModule,\n        dataModule\n    };\n}  You just instantiate your modules and return them combined in an array. But wait\u2026 we don\u2019t have these classes yet? Yes, right, lets create them!",

The  doAfterStartup  method can be left blank.  The  doBeforeStartup  method can be used to register a event listener for specific type of events (e.g. position). It can also be used to start specific algorithms or a Apache Spark application.  Here is the plan for our simple module:  Listen for positions events  Store the last event of a user in a local hashmap  On each new event calculate the traveled distance between the two positions  Therewith calculate the speed and fire a  DriveCalmRecommendationEvent  Here is an example implementation:      private HashMap<Long, Position> lastUserPositions = new HashMap<>();\n\n    private static final double kmPerHourThreshold = 100;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void doBeforeStartup() {\n        this.registerForEventOfType(Position.class, this::consumeEvent);\n    }\n\n    private void consumeEvent(Channel<Position> channel, Position newEvent) {\n        Long userId = newEvent.userId;\n\n        // Try getting the last user position\n        Position lastPosition = getLastUserPosition(userId);\n\n        // // If this isn't the first position then\n        if (lastPosition == null) {\n            // Create a new position entry for the current value\n            setLastUserPosition(newEvent);\n        } else {\n            // // We have a last position, so we can calculate a distance\n            // Check if the last position is older then the new position\n            if (lastPosition.getTimestamp().before(newEvent.getTimestamp())) {\n                // Difference based speed\n                double calculatedSpeed = (lastPosition.distance(newEvent) / 1000.0)\n                        / ((newEvent.getTimestamp().getTime() - lastPosition\n                                .getTimestamp().getTime()) / 1000.0 / 60. / 60.0);\n\n                DriveCalmRecommendationEvent recommendationEvent = buildRecommendationEvent(newEvent, calculatedSpeed);\n\n                if (calculatedSpeed > kmPerHourThreshold) {\n                    fireDriveCalmRecommendationForPosition(recommendationEvent);\n                }\n\n                // Mark this event as last position of user\n                setLastUserPosition(newEvent);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private DriveCalmRecommendationEvent buildRecommendationEvent(Position pos, double speed) {\n        DriveCalmRecommendationEvent event = new DriveCalmRecommendationEvent();\n        event.userId = pos.userId;\n        event.deviceId = pos.deviceId;\n        event.speed = speed;\n        event.timestamp = pos.timestamp;\n\n        return event;\n    }\n\n    private void fireDriveCalmRecommendationForPosition(Position pos) {\n        DriveCalmRecommendationEvent eventToFire = new DriveCalmRecommendationEvent();\n        eventToFire.userId = pos.userId;\n        this.emitEvent(eventToFire);\n    }  The detection logic could have been simplified by just checking the  speed  attribute of the  Position  event, but I wanted to present a slightly more complex alternative.  Important is the  emitEvent  method. Therewith we can push events into the event stream so other modules (including our Assistance module) can receive the information.

So here are the modifications to the data module:      @Override\n    protected void doBeforeStartup() {\n        createSchema(); // This is new!\n        this.registerForEventOfType(Position.class, this::consumeEvent);\n    }\n\n    private void createSchema() { // This is new!\n        String schemaCQL = \"CREATE TABLE drive_calm_speeds \"\n                + \"(speed double, \"\n                + \"device_id bigint, \"\n                + \"user_id bigint, \"\n                + \"id uuid, \"\n                + \"timestamp timestamp, \"\n                + \"PRIMARY KEY (user_id)\"\n                + \") \";\n\n        CassandraServiceFactory.getSessionProxy().createSchema(schemaCQL);\n    }  Next we add the save routine       private void consumeEvent(Channel<Position> channel, Position newEvent) {\n        Long userId = newEvent.userId;\n\n        // Try getting the last user position\n        Position lastPosition = getLastUserPosition(userId);\n\n        // // If this isn't the first position then\n        if (lastPosition == null) {\n            // Create a new position entry for the current value\n            setLastUserPosition(newEvent);\n        } else {\n            // // We have a last position, so we can calculate a distance\n            // Check if the last position is older then the new position\n            if (lastPosition.getTimestamp().before(newEvent.getTimestamp())) {\n                // Difference based speed\n                double calculatedSpeed = (lastPosition.distance(newEvent) / 1000.0)\n                        / ((newEvent.getTimestamp().getTime() - lastPosition\n                                .getTimestamp().getTime()) / 1000.0 / 60. / 60.0);\n\n                DriveCalmRecommendationEvent recommendationEvent = buildRecommendationEvent(newEvent, calculatedSpeed);\n\n                if (calculatedSpeed > kmPerHourThreshold) {\n                    fireDriveCalmRecommendationForPosition(recommendationEvent);\n                }\n\n                // Save in any case the current speed (THIS IS NEW!)\n                saveDriveCalmRecommendationForPosition(recommendationEvent);\n\n                // Mark this event as last position of user\n                setLastUserPosition(newEvent);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n        ...\n\n    private void saveDriveCalmRecommendationForPosition(DriveCalmRecommendationEvent eventToFire) {\n        this.getEventPersistency().persist(eventToFire);\n    }  What does happen here?

This is a convenience method to save events.

In order to be special these special clients need to access some REST API which offers more (specialized) endpoints than the generalized Platform API. For example the \u201cDrive Calm\u201d example module could offer a special endpoint where it provides a list of all speed exceedings of the last month. Or a \u201caction\u201d endpoint to clear the data, set specific setting, etc..\n\n\nHow does this extension from a communication perspective work?\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe client knows the IDs of modules. He then can make a normal HTTP request to \n/assistance/:module/custom/*path\n.
