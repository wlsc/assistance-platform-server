Therefore it offers a sleek REST API for clients to upload data (e.g. sensor data) related to a user. The user can activate / deactivate so called \"modules\". A module is some sort of extension of the \"Assistance Platform\" which consumes user data. These modules implement assistance logic (when to notify the user, when to send a mail etc.) and extract higher-level information from the stream of user / device events.\r\n\r\nThis project hosts the implementation of the Platform REST web service, the Module API and a Shared API between Modules and the Platform.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nFollow these few steps for easy installation with open source [Ansible](https://ansible.com) IT automation tool.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites on your host machine\r\n\r\n- Python >= 2.7\r\n- Ansible >= 2.1\r\n- Linux system (tested on Ubuntu 16.04)\r\n\r\n### Installation instructions\r\n\r\n- **Step 1**: Clone repository into some directory\r\n- **Step 2**: Open **config.yml** (\"assistance-platform-server/deployment/ansible/config/config.yml\") with an editor and configure your parameters. *Default*: it is ready to be installed on localhost (don't forget to edit hosts.yml if you not willing to install on localhost).\r\n- **Step 3**: After you configured it, cd to \"assistance-platform-server\\deployment\\ansible\\\" and run command \"ansible-playbook playbook.yml\". The Ansible installation will begin.\r\n- **Step 4**: Check installation was successfull by visiting http://localhost/\r\n- **Step 5**: Your copy of **Assistance Platform** is up and running.
