  "body": "# Assistance Platform (server)\r\n\r\nThe Assistance Platform is a project which aims on providing assistance to users in all thinkable situations. Therefore it offers a sleek REST API for clients to upload data (e.g. sensor data) related to a user. The user can activate / deactivate so called \"modules\". A module is some sort of extension of the \"Assistance Platform\" which consumes user data. These modules implement assistance logic (when to notify the user, when to send a mail etc.) and extract higher-level information from the stream of user / device events.\r\n\r\nThis project hosts the implementation of the Platform REST web service, the Module API and a Shared API between Modules and the Platform.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nCan be found in [wiki](https://github.com/Telecooperation/server_platform_assistance/wiki).\r\n\r\n### Developers\r\n* [Bennet Jeutter](https://github.com/eintopf)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n",
